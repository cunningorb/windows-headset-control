# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0-alpha.3] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **Switch output when off stopped working, permanently and silently.** The record of where
  the sound came from doubles as the "we owe you a move back" flag, and its presence was
  read as "already switched". Endpoint ids do not live forever — a reinstalled driver or a
  re-enumerated dongle retires one — so once that record named an endpoint the machine no
  longer had, it could never be discharged and never be replaced. Every later power-off and
  power-on did nothing at all. A record now counts only while its endpoint still exists,
  and one that never reappears is given up on after about ten seconds rather than being
  kept forever.

### Added

- **The output switch says when it can't do its job.** No device chosen, the chosen device
  unplugged, Windows refusing the change, or the device you were on having disappeared: each
  raises a notification the first time and stays on the settings row until it clears.
  Previously all four were `tracing` calls at a level no subscriber was listening to.
- `headset-tray.exe --explain-output`, which reports what the switch would do for a
  powered-off and a powered-on headset, and why, without moving anything.
- **Split game and chat**, off by default. The headset presents two playback endpoints and
  Windows keeps a separate default for calls, so the two exist precisely to be pointed at
  different roles. Putting the sound *back* the way it was found cannot do that — it names
  one endpoint — and setting that one endpoint into all three of Windows' roles overwrote a
  communications default aimed at the chat channel, so the voices came out of the game
  channel. Turn the setting on, pick a **Game channel** and a **Chat channel**, and a
  headset coming back gets ordinary sound on the first and calls on the second. Left off,
  nothing about the switch changes.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **The game/chat slider ran backwards.** The panel labelled low values CHAT and high
  values GAME, so dragging toward GAME moved the mix toward chat. `0x00` is full game and
  `0x14` full chat — a direction the captures never established, since they record the
  range and the clamps but not which end is which.

### Added

- **Switch output when off.** Turning the headset off moves Windows' sound to a
  device you choose, and turning it back on puts it where it was. Off by default. The
  trigger is the headset's link state — no power-button event exists in the protocol — so
  an auto-sleep or going out of range counts too, debounced by two seconds. Setting the
  default output has no documented Windows API; see
  [`docs/undocumented-apis.md`](docs/undocumented-apis.md).
- A light theme. It follows your Windows setting by default, with an **Appearance** override
  in settings. High contrast still wins over both.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-08-02

First released build. Alpha: it speaks a protocol reconstructed by observation and has been
run against exactly one headset.

### Added

- **An installer.** A per-user setup executable with a Start menu entry, published on the
  releases page. No administrator rights, no driver, no service.
- **An application icon.** The headset the tray draws, embedded in the executable at five
  sizes, so Explorer, the Start menu, and the shortcut all show it.

- Noise control: off, ANC, or ambient, with an ANC level of 1–4. Exposed as `headsetctl
  noise` and as a segmented control in the tray panel. Parameter `0x12`, identified by
  capture — see `docs/device-research.md`.
- The tray icon can be operated from the keyboard: focus it and press Enter or Space.
- A high-contrast palette, applied when Windows high contrast is on.
- A stable notification-icon identity, so a pin-to-taskbar choice survives reinstalling.
- A Direct2D tray panel, replacing the context-menu-only interface.

### Fixed

- The tray icon no longer disappears permanently when Explorer restarts.
- The panel opens on the monitor its icon is on, rather than being clamped to the primary
  display's work area.
- The panel renders at the display's real pixel density instead of being stretched.
- The panel is placed clear of a taskbar docked to the left or right, instead of over it.
- A second launch raises the running instance instead of adding a duplicate tray icon.
- The panel holds its bottom edge when its height changes, instead of growing downward
  over the taskbar.
- Changing a noise setting updates the panel immediately rather than a beat later.

### Changed

- Dual-licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0. Previously unlicensed and all rights reserved.

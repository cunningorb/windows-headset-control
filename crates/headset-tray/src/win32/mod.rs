//! The only `unsafe` in this crate.
//!
//! Holds the shell notification icon, the popup menu, the message loop, and the
//! Core Audio calls for microphone mute. This module exists instead of a
//! tray-icon dependency: the phase's footprint rule is zero new crates, and a
//! second confined `unsafe` module was judged the better trade. Every other
//! module in `headset-tray` is safe Rust.
//!
//! Mute lives here rather than in the device layer because it is a USB Audio
//! Class control, not a vendor command — see `docs/device-research.md`. There is
//! no vendor set-mute to call.

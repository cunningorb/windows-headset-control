//! Parameter `0x12`: the headset's noise-control mode and ANC level.
//!
//! Two payload bytes, established by capturing the vendor software driving our
//! own hardware across three sessions (see `docs/device-research.md`):
//!
//! ```text
//! byte 0   mode    0x00 off | 0x01 ANC | 0x50 ambient
//! byte 1   level   ANC strength, 0x01..=0x04
//! ```
//!
//! The write is whole-struct: the vendor software read `0x12` immediately
//! before every write and re-sent the byte it was not changing. A caller that
//! writes without reading first will clobber the other field, which is why this
//! module has no "set the mode" entry point that does not also carry a level.
